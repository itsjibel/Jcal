# Jcal
## *Jcal is my practice project for knowing more knowledge about the Qt platform, and also I tried to use my two favorite libraries named 'JMP' and 'JDS' in this project to show the flexibility of these two libraries.*
### Jcal calculator features for now:
* Multiplication
* Division
* Exponentiation
* divisibility
* Summation
* Subtraction
* Radical
